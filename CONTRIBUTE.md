# SerentityData Project (serentitydata)

[SerentityData Compiler, Runtime, Graph, and Digital Ledger Standards](https://github.com/mwherman2000/serentitydata) Project

## Purpose

The `serentitydata` project is dedicated to providing support for the design and development of enterprise and Internet class distributed applications using blockchain technologies. This includes tools and libraries (code), frameworks, how-to documentation, and best practices for enterprise distributed application development. The `serentitydata` project has a specific focus on the robust and efficient design and management of immutable, historized, and auditable data stored on a blockchain.

The `serentitydata` is an independent, free, open source project that is 100% community-supported by people like yourself through your contributions of time, energy, passion, promotion, and donations.  

## How to contribute your time and energy

Make improvments/additions one of the existing `serentitydata` projects or [start a new project of your own](https://github.com/new) (and we'll link to it. Send us the details).

* Fork the project, improve on it, and then issue a pull request
* Code changes, additional documentation, translations, ...these are all valued here at the `serentitydata`

## How to contribute your passion for a new idea

* Open an issue [here](https://github.com/mwherman2000/serentitydata/issues) and put the word **[Request]** in the title of your issue.

## How to donate to the `serentitydata-spec` project

If the `serentitydata-spec` project saved...

* Your company or organization a 1000 hours of time, energy and other resources,

...consider donating the value of a *portion* of the time, energy, and other potentially wasted resources that you, your project or your organization saved because of the tools and libraries (code), frameworks, how-to documentation, and best practices you found on the `neo-csharpcoe`.
